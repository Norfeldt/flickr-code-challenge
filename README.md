# Flickr Code Challenge

Build a small application that will display images from Flicker and optionally allow the user to search in those images as well.

- Flickr public API https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/ or something similar of your own choice
- Create a page that displays the public feed images in either a list or grid view.
- The user should be able to enter a keyword in a search box and click on a search button and the app should return images with the relevant tags.
- Use any other third party library of your choice if needed

As this is intended to be a small exercise, please consider what additional effort you would do if this was to be used in production.

# 1st sprint üèÉ‚Äç


Here is my solution to the Flickr code challenge

![animation showing the results of the first sprint](./assets/flickr-code-challenge-final-first-sprint.gif)

## Setup

1. Pull down a git clone and do `yarn install`
2. Make an `.env` file (like `.env.example`) and put in your flickr api key and secret 
3. Start the app by `yarn start` 
4. Run tests via `yarn test`

## Final saying

During development I found things that should be discussed and prioritized for a next sprint. That is located as cards in the Icebox in the KANBAN BOARD in the Projects section.

# Flickr Code Challenge

Build a small application that will display images from Flicker and optionally allow the user to search in those images as well.

- Flickr public API https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/ or something similar of your own choice
- Create a page that displays the public feed images in either a list or grid view.
- The user should be able to enter a keyword in a search box and click on a search button and the app should return images with the relevant tags.
- Use any other third party library of your choice if needed

As this is intended to be a small exercise, please consider what additional effort you would do if this was to be used in production.
